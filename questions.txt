How is scaling/positioning of templates supposed to work here?

How does OrthoView do it? I remember that the template is positioned with values based on the bottom left (x,y)

How big/small should the image be/should it be static? OrthoView has a zoom function I think?

If the template is positioned simply via the x and y coordinates then the image must be a certain size or the template
would be in the wrong place?



Where is the hotspot data?


cartesian coordinates?
